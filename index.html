        <p>Batman is a fictional superhero created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939. Batman is the alter ego of Bruce Wayne,
            a billionaire whose parents were murdered horribly in front of him when he was just a boy. This incident caused Bruce Wayne
            to vow to defend the city of Gotham from criminals and take the corruption out of the city. Batman posseses no superpowers, but uses his intellect, physicality, and intimidation to defeat his villians. Batman has also been referred to as "the caped crusader", "the dark knight", and "the world's greatest detective."</p>

        <p>Batman made his first appearance in the comic book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Comics#Batman">Detective Comics #27</a> in May of 1939 and soon became the star of the title. This issue has since become one of the most valuable
            comic books in existence, with one copy of the issue selling for over $1 million in a recent auction.</p>
